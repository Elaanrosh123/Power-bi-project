Question:
How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted different regions in terms of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries, and what are the trends over time?

Analysis Steps:

Data Collection: Obtain COVID-19 data from reliable sources such as government health agencies or reputable repositories like Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 Dashboard.

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Cleanse the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. This may involve handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.

Data Modeling: Design a data model that includes tables for regions, dates, and COVID-19 statistics (confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries). Establish relationships between these tables.

Visualization: Create visualizations to represent the data effectively. Consider using line charts to show trends over time, maps to visualize geographical distribution, and tables or cards to display key metrics.

Analysis:

Explore how confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries vary across different regions and countries.
Identify regions with the highest and lowest rates of infection, mortality, and recovery.
Examine the progression of the pandemic over time and identify any significant spikes or declines in cases, deaths, or recoveries.
Analyze the impact of public health measures or interventions on the spread of the virus.
Compare the effectiveness of responses to the pandemic in different regions.
Insights and Recommendations: Based on the analysis, draw conclusions about the impact of COVID-19 on different regions and populations. Provide recommendations for public health interventions, resource allocation, or policy decisions based on the insights gained from the data.

Using Power BI, you can easily import, clean, and visualize the data, allowing for interactive exploration and analysis of COVID-19 trends and patterns.
